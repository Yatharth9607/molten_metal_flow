# molten_metal_flow
Conjugate heat transfer analysis using Finite Volume Method for molten metal flow in horizontal channel

A brief summary of the files in this project is as follows:

1. `HW5_solution.pdf`
Comprehensive report on the solving the heat diffusion equations with the formulation of Finite Volume.

## Work in progress

-> developing interactive python modules for the matlab files to directly execute without MATLAB
